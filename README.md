This is a little arcade-style one-button single-level game for the c64. Nothing fancy, just shoot the pills and try to feed Ray with as many as possible.

The code is written for the ACME cross-assembler.

If you want to run the program on vice, just drag and drop the .prg directly from the /bin directory on it and it'll load automatically.

Enjoy!
